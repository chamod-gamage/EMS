Changes Made:
Removed list of employee numbers, replaced it with an iterator and some methods
Maid MenuFrame an attribute of MainJFrame, and provided a method to change it's visibility
Started working on the remove from table button. It works but the method of wiping the table needs to be changed, it's not scalable
Things to do:
Add functionality to edit employee button
Improve the table wiping method
Fix the stupid password screen
